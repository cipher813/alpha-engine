"""Explicit ex-date dividend accrual, and total-return SPY.

WHY (alpha-engine-config-I8188, defect 3). Two legs of the same comparison were
on different return definitions, and the direction of the bias was unknown
until it was traced:

* ``dividend_usd`` summed to **$0.00 across all 115 live sessions** while the
  book held LMT for 34 sessions, CTAS for 27, plus MA, COST, AXP, BRO and FAST
  — all payers. The source was ``IBKR.get_accrued_dividends_by_symbol()``,
  whose own docstring says "paper accounts often populate nothing" and which
  returns ``{}`` on that path. Measured: **0 non-zero ``accrued_dividend``
  values across 114 persisted snapshots.** The dividend line was structurally
  incapable of being non-zero.

* ``spy_return_pct`` was computed from ``spy_close`` alone, so SPY's
  distributions were excluded — understating the benchmark by ≈0.50pp over the
  live window.

WHICH DIRECTION THE BIAS RAN — established, not assumed. Per-position P&L is
``shares × (settled close − prior settled close)``, and the stored ArcticDB
closes are split-adjusted but explicitly NOT dividend-adjusted (alpha-engine-
data's ``corporate_actions.get_dividends``: dividends "are NEVER folded into
the stored split-adjusted price level"; ``total_return_close`` is absent from
every live library — verified against the ``macro`` and ``universe`` libraries,
which carry ``Close`` only). So position P&L is price return and excludes
dividends. The headline NAV, however, is IB NetLiquidation, which rises when
the dividend cash lands. Therefore:

    dividends were NOT dropped from the return — they were dropped from the
    ATTRIBUTION and silently credited to ``unattributed_usd``.

Corroborated in the data: on the 17 sessions with no position change, the
residual after lifting rotation out averages **+$168/session (+$2,848 total)**,
against an expected ≈$1,940 of dividends for a ~$1M book at ~55% equity
exposure and a ~1.2% yield over that many sessions. Same sign, same order of
magnitude, on exactly the days where nothing else could produce a positive
plug.

Consequences of the fix, stated plainly because it moves a published number:

* Portfolio total return is UNCHANGED — it was already total return, via NAV.
  What changes is that the dividend moves out of the unnamed plug into a named
  ``dividend_usd`` line.
* The benchmark leg RISES to total return, so reported ``daily_alpha_pct``
  FALLS by the SPY distribution yield — ≈0.50pp over 2026-03-09 → 2026-08-21.
  There is no offsetting uplift on the portfolio leg.

SOURCE. Polygon ``/v3/reference/dividends`` (ex_dividend_date + cash_amount),
via the ``PolygonClient`` already vendored in this repo and already called from
the EOD path for same-day splits (``reconciliation_audit.fetch_same_day_split_ratios``).
This mirrors that function's shape deliberately rather than inventing a second
corporate-action fetch idiom.

    cash-basis: the ex-date accrual and the cash arrival are different days,
    and the accrual ledger needs to know when to release the receivable.

    ``available`` is False when the fetch could not be performed at all (no
    ``POLYGON_API_KEY``, client construction failure, or every per-ticker call
    failing). It is NOT False for "no dividends today" — an empty dict with

    failure swallowed is a third-party HTTP/credential error on the dividend
    feed; (b) the primary deliverable — the NAV row, the positions snapshot and
    the EOD email — survives, and hard-failing the trading day's reconciliation
    on a vendor outage would be a worse trade than carrying a named
    degradation; (c) the recording surface is threefold: the returned
    ``warning`` (→ ``data_warnings`` → EOD email + console), the persisted
    ``dividend_accrual_available=0`` column, and the residual bound in
    ``pnl_integrity`` — with the accrual absent, the dividend sits back in the
