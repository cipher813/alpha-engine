"""
Resolve and load risk.yaml from the private config repo or legacy local
fallback. The example template is NEVER a valid fallback — it ships
placeholder bucket names (``"your-research-bucket-name"``) that would
silently point downstream consumers at nonexistent S3 buckets. Hit
2026-04-20 via the backtester spot path: missing risk.yaml → this
loader fell through to the example → executor built an ArcticDB URI
against the placeholder bucket → 404 surfaced as a cryptic
``KeyNotFoundException: Not found: [C:universe]`` ~100 lines deep in
the executor-sim call chain.

Search order (example template NOT a fallback — copyable only):
  1. ~/alpha-engine-config/experiments/$ALPHA_ENGINE_EXPERIMENT_ID/executor/risk.yaml
  2. {repo_root}/../alpha-engine-config/experiments/$EXP/executor/risk.yaml
  3. ~/alpha-engine-config/executor/risk.yaml          (legacy top-level)
  4. {repo_root}/../alpha-engine-config/executor/risk.yaml  (legacy, sibling)
  5. {repo_root}/config/risk.yaml                      (legacy repo-local)

Experiment-package resolution (config#1042, HARNESS_EXPERIMENT_CLASSIFICATION
§3): the executor's risk beliefs load from
``experiments/$ALPHA_ENGINE_EXPERIMENT_ID/executor/risk.yaml`` (default
experiment ``reference``) ahead of the legacy top-level ``executor/risk.yaml``,
which is retained as a fallback through the transition. Mirrors the loader in
alpha-engine-research/config.py::_find_config and
alpha-engine-data/weekly_collector.py::load_config. The experiment id is read
from the environment at import time (consistent with the sibling loaders) — set
``ALPHA_ENGINE_EXPERIMENT_ID`` before the process starts to select a slot.

Path resolution is deliberately LAZY — consumers call ``get_config_path()``
or ``load_config()`` at runtime, not at import time. An import-time
``CONFIG_PATH = get_config_path()`` would hard-fail any test, CI runner,
or tooling that merely imports executor without needing to read config.
The old module-level constant was only safe because the removed .example
fallback guaranteed resolution — that's exactly the silent-fallthrough
trap this PR closes. Callers that used to import ``CONFIG_PATH`` now
import ``get_config_path`` and resolve inline.

    executor entrypoint calls ``setup_logging`` with this path at *import time*,
    so a ``FileNotFoundError`` would block process startup. The repo-root copy
    ships in-tree (always present in a normal checkout), so resolution normally
    succeeds at the package or repo-root candidate; if nothing resolves (e.g. an
    installed wheel that did not vendor the yaml), we degrade exactly as the
