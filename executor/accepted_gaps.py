"""Accepted gaps registry — dates with permanently-unrecoverable eod_pnl gaps.

When a trading day's snapshot never existed (CaptureSnapshot failed
permanently, alpha-engine-config-I5569) and is accepted as unrecoverable by
operator ruling (alpha-engine-config-I5325), ``reconcile_audit`` must stop
paging about it every run. This registry provides the durable, queryable
record of such rulings — a liveness fact, not an inference from prose.

S3 location: s3://{trades_bucket}/config/accepted_gaps.json

Schema:
::

    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "gaps": [
        {
          "date": "2026-07-27",
          "reason": "CaptureSnapshot failed permanently — snapshot never existed",
          "ruling": "nousergon/alpha-engine-config#5325",
          "accepted_at": "2026-07-29T00:00:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }

Adding a future accepted gap requires only a record in this file, not a code
change. Each entry is an operator action tied to a specific ruling — a gap
suppressed without a ruling is a corrupted alpha series with the evidence
deleted (see the Gotcha in alpha-engine-config#5570).

    Returns a dict keyed by date string (``"2026-07-27"`` → entry dict).
    Returns an empty dict if the file does not exist or is inaccessible

    An empty registry is a valid state; every S3 access failure is
    logged but never fatal, because the gap handler downstream degrades
    gracefully (logs at INFO, not WARNING, for accepted gaps) and a
    missing registry at worst means a gap gets flagged when it could
    have been silent — better than silently suppressing a real gap.
